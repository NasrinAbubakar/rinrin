When i was on grade 7 I don't have any expensive clothes and my classmates says "did i  know who I am" I answered "Yes I know who am I". Yeah! I'm not rich and I  don't have enough money to buy foods and my needed but I will do my best to enrich my presence. After a months, my mother bought me a shirt with a price of P25.00 and I'm so happy that time. I don't know why my classmates looking at me everytime I wear that shirt. Ihave only 3 clothes and 2 lower clothes that time, well I have knowledge to think how to use my clothes in alternate. In my Grade 8 and 9 level bullying was gone but the insecurity was appeared.
